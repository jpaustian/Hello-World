# Hello-World
Ideas, Testing, &amp; Expanding Knowledge:
My name is Julia.  I am a recent college grad from Metro State University of Denver.  I am passionate about computers & customer service.  I love to enjoy life to my fullest by taking in all Colorado has to offer for outdoor adventure: hiking, snowboarding, whitewater rafting, and my new recent favorite Skydiving!  I also am on a bowling league with my family for fun!
